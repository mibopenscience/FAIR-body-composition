# FAIR-body-composition
In this repository we present the semantic model in RDF for two cases (mock data):
1. A subject who was a patient with a feminine gender and fat-free mass measured with a BODPOD (Air displacement plethysmography)
2. A subject who was not a patient with a masculine gender and resistance + reactance measured with a BIA (Bio-electrical Impedance Analysis)
More information about the project and data: see the [Github-wiki ](https://github.com/mibopenscience/FAIR-body-composition/wiki)
